		<h3> ABOUT US </h3>
		<img id="animal" src="dog_aboutus.jpg" alt="image" style=width:250px;height:250px;float:left/>
		Durham House of Pets was founded in 1955 by Mr. John Smith. Smith lived in Dover, NH his entire life on
		his father's farm, mostly responsible for caring for the animals. Not soon after he began renting out 
		a store on Main Street in Durham, formally a smoke shop, in hopes of selling pet products to the local residents
		and college students. Smith retired in 1995, handing the business over to his son John
		Smith II. At first the store only sold dogs and cats but has since expanded to selling snakes and fish. 
		The family has continued providing supplies for pets such as food, toys, and cages/tanks for years since.
		In additional to the original Durham location there are also two branches in Nashua, NH and Hampton, NH. The 
		corporate office exists above the store in Durham.

		products to live a happy and healthy life. To us, you and your pets are family not just another customer, so we
